\title{Student's Sleep Data}
\description{
  Data which show the effect of two soporific drugs (increase in hours
  of sleep compared to control) on 10 patients.
}
\usage{sleep}
\format{
  A data frame with 20 observations on 3 variables.
  \tabular{rlll}{
    [, 1] \tab extra \tab numeric \tab increase in hours of sleep\cr
    [, 2] \tab group \tab factor  \tab drug given\cr
    [, 3] \tab ID    \tab factor  \tab patient ID
  }

\details{
  The \code{group} variable name may be misleading about the data:
  They represent measurements on 10 persons, not in groups.
  %% But we keep it (as [,2]) for back compatibility.
