/* S Like Fortran Interface */
/* These may not be adequate everywhere. Convex had _ prepending common
   blocks, and some compilers may need to specify Fortran linkage.

   HP-UX did not add a trailing underscore.  (It still existed in
   2024, but R poiorts had not been seen for many years.)

   Note that this is an F77 interface, intended only for valid F77
   names of <= 6 ASCII characters (and no underscores) and there is an
   implicit assumption that the Fortran compiler maps names to
   lower-case (and 'x' is lower-case when called).

   The configure code has

   HAVE_F77_EXTRA_UNDERSCORE
   Define if your Fortran compiler appends an extra_underscore to
   external names containing an underscore.

   but that is not used here (and none of gfortran, flang-new nor
   x86_64 ifx do so: earlier Intel x86 compilere might have).  It is
   used in Rdynload.c to support .Fortran.

   These macros have always been the same in R.  Their documented uses are

   F77_SUB to define a function in C to be called from Fortran 
   F77_NAME to declare a Fortran routine in C before use 
   F77_CALL to call a Fortran routine from C
