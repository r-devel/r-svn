 ......

 The current version has very serious cancellation issues.  For example,
 if you ask for a small right-tail you are likely to get total cancellation.
 For example,  phyper(59, 150, 150, 60, FALSE, FALSE) gives 6.372680161e-14.
 The right answer is dhyper(0, 150, 150, 60, FALSE) which is 5.111204798e-22.

 phyper is also really slow for large arguments.

 Therefore, I suggest using the code below. This is a sniplet from Gnumeric ...
 The code isn't perfect.  In fact, if  x*(NR+NB)  is close to	n*NR,
 then this code can take a while. Not longer than the old code, though.

 -- Thanks to Ian Smith for ideas.
