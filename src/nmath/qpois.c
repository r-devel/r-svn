 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	The quantile function of the Poisson distribution.
 *
 *  METHOD
 *
 *	Uses the Cornish-Fisher Expansion to include a skewness
 *	correction to a normal approximation.  This gives an
 *	initial value which never seems to be off by more than
 *	1 or 2.	 A search is then conducted of values close to
 *	this initial start point.
