 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *	#include <Rmath.h>
 *	double qnbinom(double p, double size, double prob,
 *                     int lower_tail, int log_p)
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	The quantile function of the negative binomial distribution,
 *      for the (size, prob) parametrizations
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *	x = the number of failures before the n-th success
 *
 *  METHOD
 *
 *	Uses the Cornish-Fisher Expansion to include a skewness
 *	correction to a normal approximation.  This gives an
 *	initial value which never seems to be off by more than
 *	1 or 2.	 A search is then conducted of values close to
 *	this initial start point.
