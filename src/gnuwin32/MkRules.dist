## This is only used when building R itself but it does customize
## etc/*/Makeconf: see fixed/Makefile

## Customize by copying to MkRules.local and uncommenting and editing 
## some of the definitions there. The values are tailored to Rtools43, the
## currently recommented toolchain using gcc 12.2, MinGW-w64 10, 64-bit only,
## UCRT. R is only intended to be built for 64-bit UCRT as of R 4.2. 

## =========== configuration macros for building packages ================

# LOCAL_SOFT is intended to point to software collection with static
# libraries and headers installed "outside of Rtools", in the same spirit as
# software is installed on Linux into '/usr/local' if it is not available in
# the respective Linux distribution. 
#
# CRAN distributed this software and running 'make rsync-extsoft' would
# populate the default directory $(R_HOME)/extsoft.  The versions used on
# CRAN recommended for R 2.14.2 to 3.2.4 can still be found at
# https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/libs.html
#
# Eventually, this software collection became part of Rtools, so it should
# no longer be referred to via LOCAL_SOFT.  Rtools42 hence introduce
# variable R_TOOLS_SOFT for use in R packages to refer to headers or
# libraries in the Rtools software collection (which in turn can be
# influenced by R_CUSTOM_TOOLS_SOFT for packages).  LOCAL_SOFT should not be
# used for that purpose.  R source code refers to that software collection
# using EXT_LIBS.
#
# However, a number of CRAN packages ended up referring to Rtools software
# collection via LOCAL_SOFT, so LOCAL_SOFT is set up by default to also
# point to the Rtools software. This may be changed in the future.
#
# To build R from source with Rtools43 (installed from installer as well as
# tarball), gcc has to be on PATH and LOCAL_SOFT can be computed as follows:
#
# LOCAL_SOFT ?= $(shell which `echo $(CC) | sed -e 's/ .*//g'` | sed -e 's!/bin/[^/]\+!!g')
#
## ============== configuration macros for building R ===================

# Path of library directory containing zlib, bzlib, liblzma, pcre,
# libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, xz.

# G_FLAG = -gdwarf-2

# Set to YES and specify the path if you want to use the ATLAS BLAS.
# USE_ATLAS = NO

# Support for the ACML and Goto BLASes has been withdrawn: see R-admin.html

# Define to use svnversion to set SVN-REVISION (slow, and requires a clean
# checkout with no modifications).

# This can also be used to give the full path to the compiler, 
# including a trailing / .  
# BINPREF = 
# Set this to indicate a non-gcc compiler and version
# COMPILED_BY = <determined automatically>

# Others use a -m64 or -m32 option to select architectures

# AS_ARCH =
# and for windres (-F pe-i386 or pe-x86-64)

# DT_ARCH =

# The gcc 4.9.3 64 bit toolchain is set up for the 'medium code' model and needs
# to remove the .refptr and .weak entries from the exports list; this is the default
# when WIN = 64, with blank for WIN = 32:
# NM_FILTER = | $(SED) -e '/[.]refptr[.]/d' -e '/[.]weak[.]/d'

# We normally link directly against DLLs, 
# but this macro forces the use of import libs
# Has been needed for some versions of MinGW-w64
# USE_IMPLIBS = YES

# set to use MiKTeX (and unset otherwise)
# MIKTEX = TRUE
# TEXI2DVI = texi2dvi
# MiKTEX no longer provides texi2dvi and needs something like (previous toolchains)

# TEXI2DVI = env COMSPEC= texi2dvi

# for texinfo >= 5.1. If the texinfo files are installed at /packages/texinfo,
# TEXI2ANY = /path/to/perl -I/packages/texinfo /packages/texinfo/texi2any
# if you do not have texinfo (default),
# TEXI2ANY = missing

# additional optimization flags (e.g. -mtune=native for a private build)
#
# -mstackrealign is used to avoid traps due to misaligned addresses with
#   SSE2 (seen on 32-bit builds with forced SSE2 using -mfpmath=sse -msse2,
#   probably not needed on 64-bit builds)
#
# -fexceptions was used as a workaround for GCC 10.3.0 bug causing crashes in
#   long jumps due to invalid unwind tables. This is the only reason for
#   this option as R does not use structured exception handling from C.
#   https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=103274
#   
#   -fno-reorder-blocks-and-partition was not a suitable workaround because
#   of https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=103465
#
#   (reorder-blocks-and-partition has been fixed in GCC, so -fexceptions
#   should no longer be needed for newer versions of GCC and the recommended
#   toolchain)
